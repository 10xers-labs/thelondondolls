  <p class="">Lip fillers enhance the natural shape of your lips and give you the desired pout you have never achieved before, they replace lost volume through ageing and plump out any lines that are there whatever age you are. </p><p class=""> Lip fillers are a semi permanent implant. It is an augmentation because we are putting something into your body. The product is soft and malleable, we insert into the lip tissue and massage the lip filler into place.&nbsp; It is my goal to produce only natural looking healthy lips.&nbsp; </p><p class="">Unfortuately lip fillers have been given a really bad name in the press, due to alot of celebrity abuse and tabloid exposure. I believe it is our moral duty to promote only natural looking aesthetic treatments and strive for this aesthetic to become the precedent compared to a very stretched over done look.&nbsp;</p><p class="">It can take 2 weeks or more for the lips to heal and it is very normal for swelling, tenderness and bruising. Some bruising can last a few weeks, it is totally up to the individual on how the body heals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">Lip fillers last around 6-9 months, your body motabilises them over time and this can be affected by your lifestyle too- exercise, drinking and party drugs can affect the lifetime span of the lip fillers.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Your at home aftercare consists of massaging your lips for 3 days post treatment, drinking at tleast 3 litres of water a day for 3 days after treatment, avoiding heat, sauna steam treatments for 2 weeks, avoiding heavy exercise and abstaining from alcohol for 24 hours post treatment. You can apply make up the next day to cover any skin bruising. </p><p class="">At TLD Aesthetics we use a variety of lip fillers to suit your needs. We stock Juvederm 0.55ml and 1ml.

I for one have not found the transition into lockdown life particularly easy however I know I am not alone in my anxiety as everyone is in the same situation. Over the last couple of weeks I have developed a few tips that have helped keep me calm and positive!</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class=""><strong>Keep a routine!</strong> In the first week or so I really struggled to get into a routine, I overslept, I overate and I spent all night watching Tiger King which had a big effect on my mental and physical health. Since getting into a routine of going to bed at a reasonable time, eating at regular meal times and waking up early to start my day, along with a few fun activities in between, I began to feel normal again! Your routine doesn’t need to be the same as mine so find what works for you and stick to it!</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Set achievable and precise goals!</strong> If you are working from home, like myself, it can be hard to find the motivation to put down TikTok and pick up the laptop. I was extremely unmotivated with both my professional life and personal life, often spending great amounts of time on streaming apps and social media until I began to set goals for myself. I found that daily and weekly goals helped me, for example “Do one hour of social media optimization a day” or “At 12pm follow the Popfit team in a workout”. This does not only to those working from home but to daily tasks as well, like cooking or exercise.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Talk to friends and family!</strong> Everyone is experiencing the lockdown so we could all do with some love whether you call them, text them or FaceTime them. Talking is therapeutic, I know for myself that speaking to both friends and family lifts my spirit. My grandmother, who lives alone, and appreciates our chats enormously, always makes me laugh with her silly jokes. Not only will you feel more uplifted but I can guarantee that you will make someone else’s day!</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Take a break from social media and the news! </strong>It is important to know what is happening in the world however I find that the negativity and constant reminder of death in the news is extremely anxiety inducing. I have not turned the news on in weeks and felt better for it however I am not encouraging avoiding it all together, I recommend limiting your intake. The same applies to social media, it is a black hole that I can’t escape! I can spend hours on Instagram and TikTok and not even realise. Limit your time or try a weekend without social media, you will find that your day opens up to a whole range of fun possibilities.</p></li><li><p class=""><strong>Do something fun! </strong>Aim to do at least one fun activity a day such as:</p></li></ol><p class="">1. Colouring, not just for children, I love my colouring book and jazzy new felt tips!</p><p class="">2. Cycling, although some areas have been restricted there are still beautiful places to cycle through, it is a great workout and you get some time outside of the house. You don’t need to own a bicycle as pay as you go bikes are all around London.</p><p class="">3. Baking, not only is it a fun activity, to do with the whole household or alone, you get to eat what you bake! My easy recommendations are, (the very popular) banana bread, lemon drizzle cake and a classic Victorian sponge cake however you can bake whatever you imagine!&nbsp;</p><p class="">4. Exercise, not all will find this a fun activity but grab a partner or link up with your BFF’s on Houseparty and get your sweat on together to some loud music! You can also join <a href="https://www.wearepopfit.com/popfitonline"><span>Popfit</span></a> online for their digital workouts, I know I have!</p><p class="">5. Cocktail making, similar to baking but not suitable for under 18s!</p><p class="">6. Drawing, painting or even sculpture, let your creativity out with all this free time!</p><p class="">7.

After the treatment brows need to be moisturised daily or they can get dehydrated we recommend <a href="https://www.thelondondolls.com/shop/bybi-supercharge-serum-concentrated-active-formula"><span>BYBI Supercharge Serum</span></a> and <a href="https://www.thelondondolls.com/shop/nouveau-lash-and-brow-conditioning-serum"><span>Nouveau’s Lash and Brow Conditioning Serum</span></a>.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">Brow Lamination has covered a gap in the market to spruce up brows that need more than the regular HD brow, it does so much more than just tint!

  <p class="">Autumn is here but winter will be approaching soon which means cinnamon flavoured everything, candles, cookies and coffee, because nothing smells more like Christmas than cinnamon! However as the weather changes we need to be conscious to change our skincare routine. Multiple factors can affect your skin and the weather is one of them, just as you would pack sunscreen for your holiday or the occasional day the sun comes out in England, you need to take care of your skin in the winter! </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>MAKE SURE TO KEEP HYDRATED!</h2><p class="">Keeping your body and skin hydrated during the colder months is important because as your skin becomes drier it also becomes more sensitive. A gentle cleanser is always essential to healthy skin as it makes it easier to take in moisture and vitamins. Sheet masks are a great way to keep your skin hydrated and are a vital piece of my skincare routine, especially in winter, as they are incredibly moisturising. The sheet mask works by creating a seal between the mask and your skin to stop the serum from evaporating so it all sinks into your skin. Once you take off the mask you pat down the serum because we want none to go to waste. Unlike other moisturisers or creams that will evaporate the sheet mask force feeds your skin the moisture so you are guaranteed hydrated skin every use. You can find Korean sheet masks in the studio and on our shop website. Pick one up after your appointment!&nbsp;</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>USE A SERUM!</h2><p class="">Winter can leave skin looking dull and tired, if you don’t want a professional treatment such as a peel, we recommend Bybi’s Supercharge Serum which is completely vegan and cruelty free. It is a light oil-based serum that energises and repairs dull and tired complexions. Made with 18 antioxidant-rich natural oils and potent nutrients including Vitamins A, C and E which promotes rapid cell renewal. This counters the harsh effects of winter, leaving skin looking bright and beautiful. It is now stocked in the studio and on our shop website.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>AVOID CHAPPED HANDS AND ‘LICK ECZEMA’</h2><p class="">Licking sore lips will only worsen the dryness and can cause what is called ‘lick eczema’ but this is easily avoided by using an effective lip balm such as Burt’s Bees Lip Balm which is a beeswax based lip balm which can be used to prevent sore lips and to repair cracked, chapped and burning lips. It contains Vitamin E, peppermint and other natural ingredients. Your hands are also at risk of chapping due to the cold weather so remember to regularly moisturise but if that is not enough during these colder months try a collagen hand mask. Similar to a sheet mask, the collagen hand mask is a glove packed with vitamins and moisture. The glove forces everything to seep into your skin, the moisture can not escape or evaporate, the difference is amazing when finished. We now stock collagen hand masks at the studio, can be brought to take home or during a treatment with the option for a hand massage. </p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>YOUR SKINCARE ROUTINE CHANGES AS THE WEATHER DOES, DON’T FORGET TO STAY HYDRATED!</h2>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a5deb2ef43b5527111ef318/1543339921191-43KZ0WDA8F0W5ENBPNUB/WINTER+IS+COMING%21_image+1.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1293" height="813"><media:title type="plain">“Winter Is Coming!”</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Sheet Masks: The K Beauty Trend</title><dc:creator>beth camilleri</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2018 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thelondondolls.com/blog-archive/2018/10/30/natural-textures</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a5deb2ef43b5527111ef318:5bd84a561905f4e57ed4cffd:5bd84b520d9297b74f3f64d2</guid><description><![CDATA[<h3>SHEET MASKS THROW SHADE AT YOUR WINTER WOES!</h3>

  <h2>WHAT IS A SHEET MASK?</h2><p class="">Korean skincare routines have become one of the most popular trends of 2018, the most beloved aspect of them is the sheet mask which has been rocked in selfies by Bella Hadid and Lady Gaga. Sheet masks are one of the best ways to combat the winter woes by hydrating your skin and packing it full of vitamins. The sheet is made of a special paper which creates a seal on the skin this locks in the moisture and vitamins to stop them evaporating allowing your skin to soak in all of the good stuff.</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h2>HOW TO USE A SHEET MASK?</h2><p class="">To use a sheet mask effectively you must first,</p><p class="">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first step to using a sheet mask is to wash your face, by cleansing the skin of dirt and impurities you are preparing it to receive vitamins and moisture. Applying a toner also prepares your pores for the sheet masking experience by balancing your pH levels.</p><p class="">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start from the forehead and pat down gently as the mask works it’s way down your skin, simultaneously you must line us the eyes, nose and mouth spaces to your own. Once the mask is on you can relax, watch some television, do some yoga, listen to some ambient music. Do as you please while the mask works it’s magic, the time is dependent on what mask you use.</p><p class="">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the time is up no need to rinse, just pat the remaining moisture into your skin and feel the benefits of hydrated, soft skin.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><h2>HOW OFTEN CAN I USE A SHEET MASK?</h2><p class="">You can use a sheet mask as often as you like throughout the day or the week, most would recommend using a sheet mask 3 times a week or once a day for some extra care. In Korea, it is a part of many peoples skincare routine, they use them daily for constant hydrated, healthy skin.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><h2>WHERE CAN I PURCHASE A SHEET MASK?</h2><p class="">For authentic sheet masks all you have to do is drop by our studio where we sell a range of sheet masks, why not add this popular Korean product to your skincare routine or as an occasional pampering treat.</p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">If you’re still not convinced pop in and have a chat with our front of house team who can answer all your queries. </p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a5deb2ef43b5527111ef318/1543335441850-J9T2349T2P9449UX9627/Sheet+Masks-+The+K+Beauty+Trend+_image+1.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1293" height="813"><media:title type="plain">Sheet Masks: The K Beauty Trend</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Autumn Mani-claws!</title><dc:creator>beth camilleri</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2018 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.thelondondolls.com/blog-archive/2018/10/30/natural-textures-ekbkf</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a5deb2ef43b5527111ef318:5bd84a561905f4e57ed4cffd:5bfd62de758d46ac48609d27</guid><description><![CDATA[<h3>LET’S TALK ABOUT NAIL TRENDS ON THE CATWALK AND OUR FAVOURITES AT THE STUDIO!</h3>

  <p class="">It’s finally autumn! After the longest and hottest summer that London has seen in a while, I’m personally craving big wooly knitwear, crisp air and new autumn nail trends! If you’re struggling with the chilly weather and lack of sun allow me to remind you that the children are back in school, going for walks just got prettier as the leaves change colour (visit London Fields, just round the corner from the studio!) and halloween is almost upon us! We have some spooky nail art at the studio which we are dying to do! Our front of house honey, Charlotte, recently had a murderous manicure, with the base colour Cakepop by CND (a sweet pink) with sassy spiders painted on her index and middle finger on both hands. Spooky and stylish statement nails for halloween!</p><p class="">So, this Autumn we have seen some funky features on the catwalk and some of our favourite classics! At the studio we’ve been particularly smitten with the two tone manicure, one swipe of Cityscape by CND and a clear coat and we’re falling like the leaves around us! Colour blocking or the two tone manicure is so on trend right now. Personally,&nbsp; I like to keep it simple with a nude and a clear coat but you can get as creative as you like with this look! One doll who came to the studio opted for Wildfire by CND (classic red) and Cocoa by CND (brown nude) and it was fabulous!</p><p class="">Also hitting the runway this autumn, is a classic: deep red.&nbsp; Although, it is not exclusive to this season it is a classic that is always relevant to mention! Temperley London’s autumn/winter show displayed strong women’s fashion in the style of the 1930’s and 1940’s which included a beautiful singed scarlet shade which made them look like the fierce ladies they are. I would recommend Wildfire or Decadence by CND to recreate the look. </p>

  <p class="">I love a nude. Not the kind of nude you send out on a friday night after a bottle of pinot, no. I’m talking about the sassy shades we paint on our nails! Nudes or muted shades are so versatile, they match every outfit whether your style is bold and creative, sleek and sophisticated or if you just like to bum around in pajamas all day! They look sexy alone or part of an elaborate nail art. Tom Ford did a subtle reverse French manicure with a half moon-like shape at the cuticle line with a glossy nude. Lead nail technician Marian Newman loves a nude, at the Roland Mouret line up all the models had a gorgeous nude varnish to compliment their look.</p><p class="">From naughty nudes to ravishing reds and all the funky looks in between, we, at The London Dolls, cannot wait to have you in for your next nail appointment. </p><p class="">&nbsp;</p><p class="">Love, </p><p class="">TLD’s xx</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a5deb2ef43b5527111ef318/1543335491510-JM89503DENQYNDR2WPDT/Autumn+Mani-claws%21_Image+2.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1293" height="813"><media:title type="plain">Autumn Mani-claws!</media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
